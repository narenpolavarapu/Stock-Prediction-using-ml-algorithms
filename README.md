# Storck-Prediction-using-ml-algorithms

This project aims to develop enhanced predictive models for stock movement using
machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict whether the stock index will
move up or down based on historical data, including OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and
Volume data from Yahoo Finance, along with macroeconomic features from FRED
(Federal Reserve Economic Data).
Stock movement prediction is crucial for investors and traders to make informed
decisions in dynamic financial markets. Traditional methods often lack accuracy and
reliability, necessitating the adoption of advanced machine learning algorithms. By
leveraging historical data and integrating both micro-level market data and
macroeconomic indicators, this project seeks to provide actionable insights into stock
market behavior.
Through rigorous experimentation with various machine learning techniques such as
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), this
project aims to identify the most effective models for stock movement prediction. The
outcomes of this research have the potential to improve investment strategies and risk
management practices in financial markets.
